# SleepNow
*translated by Google Translate. If he translated incorrectly, please correct.

Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.16.4 
- Allows you to skip the night if a certain number of people are sleeping on the server at the same time.
- Displays in chat how many players it takes to skip the night.
- Displays a message in the chat when the required number of players are gathered, and the night is skipped.

What needs to be implemented:
1. Test the plugin (on a server with more than 4 players) and report bugs.

settings.yml:
- Configures the output of messages to the chat.
- Changes the language of the chat output.

Languages (or if you need just change chat text) for the plugin can be added along the path plugins/SleepNow/language/you_language.yml, similar to the sleepnow_en.yml file (which will be created after the first launch of the plugin).

Standard and additional languages can be downloaded here (or create yourself):
